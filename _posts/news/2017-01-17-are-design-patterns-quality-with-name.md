Actually I've not read Christopher Alexander's books like [*The Timeless Way of Building*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Timeless_Way_of_Building). While it's a book about architecture, there's a concept which the author calls *quality without a name* that should strike you.

In summary, Cristopher Alexander defines that there're some things that can't be *named* but they're still considered to have quality.

## Do design patterns are *quality with name*?

Perhaps many software developers are currently implementing their software following many paradigms and architectural design patterns, and there've been a trend since more than 20 years which dictates that *good* software should follow certain design patterns. We would say: *don't reinvent the square wheel, there's a design pattern to solve this problem*.

That is, most developers consider that a software implementing paradigms and design patterns are done with quality in mind. Consider that you're implementing a solution based on *domain-driven design*. Just try to discuss with someone behind such development if it has quality or not and you'll end up with a pointless discussion.

Does *domain-driven design* mean *quality software* by definition? I don't think so: it'll depend on a lot of things, because the fact that you claim that your solution has implemented *domain-driven design* doesn't mean that it does at all, does it?

Does calling a class with a suffix like *Service* turns your class into a *service layer*? This is what I call *heroic naming* and I consider it an anti-pattern.

You know that all questions are answered with a great ***NO***!

My understanding of *design patterns* is that **their motivation is working as generalized solutions to influence yours**. Does this mean that implementing design patterns turns out that your solutions have quality? *No*. 

What really makes the difference are your choices and how you end up implementing your software solution. *Do some parts of your software look like some existing design pattern?*. **Don't hesitate to suffix those parts that can be easily recognized by a known design pattern, because every collaborator will have an easier path to understand your solution, as there's a lot of documentation and tons of books about them out there!**.

Hence, you should find in design patterns a way to get inspired and start software architecture discussions founded on previous community's knowledge, **and don't use them to excuse a poor quality *with a name***.

**In summary**, I would conclude that design patterns aren't *quality with a name* because they're not about quality, but about approaches to solve certain problems that need to adjusted to your actual use cases: **they're not the Ten Commandments of Software**.

**Hereby, your software is *quality without a name* depending on how you defend it!**. It has nothing to do on *how you architect it*.
