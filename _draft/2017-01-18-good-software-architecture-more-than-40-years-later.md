Let's start the discussion with a diagram and check the signature at the bottom of it:

Did you notice that there's a signature from **1970**? 

When I was a teenager, I had some low moments but I had the chance (and good luck) to live with **Ferdinando Marzoni** for some years. He's unknown for the masses, but **he was a programmer from the 70s to 90s**, and he experienced the early ages of software and computing. **Some of his clients were IBM and Pirelli**.

A while before he died, he inherited me many functional and technical analysis from projects for oil market, public administration and stock management. The diagram included on this article is part of one of these analysis composed by more than 500 pages each one!

## In 1970, there was no *domain-driven design*, *test-driven development*, *MVC* or many other concepts, paradigms, practices...

Software programmers from the 70s were very different than ours. Computers were just evolving and their computational power and memory were very very limited, and software engineering was just a dream. Moreover, professionals had to emerge learning from technical papers, and it wasn't easy to work with hexadecimal codes, or later code everything with machine language (i.e. *assembler*). Other projects were already implemented using Basic, C, Fortran, Cobol and relational databases.

As software programming was considered a task done by extraterrestrials, projects were well-paid for the effort that required to end up with a good solution. Also, finding programmers was an extreme hard time!

Ferdinando Marzoni explained me that old days' projects were funded with over 1 million dollars and clients weren't never obstructive during the development process: they provided the resources and relied on professionals. Projects were always planned to be executed during 1-2 years, and it was always an initial intensive task to document all concerns exposed by the client. Anyway, Ferdinando did partial demonstrations of the products being developed to validate them against the client.

While the key point on 70s-80s projects was memory/processor efficiency rather than a comprehensive and ultra-productive software architecture, he pointed me that even with procedural programming he and his teams implemented well-structured code. In fact, when he was too old to continue as programmer and it took place the transition from MS-DOS to Windows and graphical environments, as programming languages were more and more higher-level, he thought that programmers didn't care about producing *good software* but they started to be more focused on the result: *it just works, what's the issue with this, eh!*.
